# Analyze-Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handers-with-Left-Handers
## About the Project 
Barack Obama is left-handed. So are Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey; 
so were Babe Ruth and Marie Curie. A 1991 study reported that left handed people die on average nine years earlier than right-handed 
people. Nine years! Could this really be true? 
In this project, you will explore this phenomenon using age 
distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average 
age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over 
time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. This 
notebook uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the 
probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported 
as left-handed or right-handed. 

This project lets you apply the skills from pandas Foundations, 
Statistical Thinking in Python, Introduction to Data Visualization 
with Python, and concepts from Foundations of Probability in R and 
Fundamentals of Bayesian Data Analysis in R, including reading 
data, creating new columns, creating matplotlib visualizations, using 
numpy arrays, constructing probabilities from frequency data, and 
Bayes' theorem. We recommend that you take those courses before 
starting this project. 

## Objectives of Project

1. Investigate Handedness-Longevity Relationship:
The primary objective of this project is to examine whether there exists a statistically significant difference in death ages between individuals classified as right-handers and left-handers. By utilizing Bayesian analysis, we aim to explore the potential association between handedness and longevity.

2. Utilize Bayesian Methodology:
This project aims to employ Bayesian analysis as the statistical framework for investigating the handedness-longevity relationship. The objective is to harness the power of Bayesian techniques to integrate prior beliefs with empirical evidence, facilitating a nuanced analysis that considers existing knowledge.

3. Formulate Informed Prior Beliefs:
A crucial objective is the formulation of prior beliefs that are informed by existing literature, expert opinions, and relevant data. These prior beliefs serve as the foundation for the Bayesian analysis, allowing us to incorporate existing understanding into the analysis of new data.

4. Construct Likelihood Functions:
The project seeks to construct likelihood functions that describe the probability of observing the given dataset under various hypotheses about the handedness-longevity relationship. This objective involves translating the observed data into a form that can be integrated into the Bayesian analysis.

5. Calculate Posterior Distributions:
By applying Bayes' theorem, this project aims to calculate the posterior distributions that represent the updated beliefs about death age distributions for both right-handers and left-handers. This objective involves combining prior beliefs with observed evidence to refine our understanding.

6. Estimate Mean Death Ages:
Utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, the project seeks to estimate the mean death ages for both right-handers and left-handers. This objective involves drawing samples from the posterior distributions to provide estimates that reflect the central tendencies of the datasets.

7. Compare Posterior Distributions:
An important objective is to compare the posterior distributions for death ages between right-handers and left-handers. This objective aims to determine the probability of observing a significant difference in death ages between the two groups.

8. Provide Insights and Interpretation:
The project's objective includes providing a comprehensive interpretation of the results obtained from the Bayesian analysis. This involves explaining the implications of observed differences or similarities in death ages and discussing their potential significance in the context of brain lateralization and health.
